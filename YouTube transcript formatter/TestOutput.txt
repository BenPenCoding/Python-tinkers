 hi guys in this clip we are gonna review the four stick skills needed to play lacrosse are passing catching scooping and cradling let's dive right into it first we're going to talk about passing when it comes to passing let's first talk about our hand placement we're gonna put our dominant hand right in the middle of the stick and our other hand writes on the bottom from there I'm going to use the rebounder to demonstrate we're gonna point push and pull we're going to point our butt in and point our elbow all right now we're going to push pull to release the ball as we get that push-pull motion just like any other sport so I'm going to football similar to thrown in baseball we're gonna step with our opposite foot and as soon as you plant you snap that ball out of there next Catching we're gonna talk about catching the ball again hand placement we're going to take our dominant hand and slide it up to the plastic of the head we're going to take our off hand and put it on the butt end of the stick here now from here we need to present a target to our teammate so that target is getting the stick vertical we have an imaginary box by our ear in our shoulder notice the stick is not in front of my face it's in the box now from here I like teaching my kids to think of the ball as a water balloon or an egg and we have to give with it so we don't break that water balloon or that egg now as we cushion that ball that ball is not bouncing off our plastic and falling onto the grass one more thing we're not at the hip right we're up vertical again the face shape of the stick is facing my partner I'm not going to twist that at all that's going to help me get that give action there we're going to use the rebounder again to demonstrate a couple reps here now we have scooping we're gonna miss Scooping the ball every once in a while but we're gonna go chase it down and learn the skill of scooping it up again hand placement hand up at the plastic bottom hand at the very bottom of the stick this helps our hand-eye coordination and connecting that scoop a little bit better we're gonna plant our dominant foot next to the ball yeah the stick low and our own body low I'm bending at the knees so my body's low you see a lot of kids try and scoop where they're picking at it they gotta get the butt end of the stick low so now I can get under the ball and scoop through it now we're cradling going to go over cradling cradling is very important to keep the ball in the pocket of the stick as we cradle here that force is throwing it back to the mesh or the netting that makes up the pocket you notice my elbow is moving back and forth but also I have a loose wrist as I come down my wrist is opening up as I come up my wrist is closing and that's what gets that rocking motion so if we miss a pass it's okay we're going to go scoop it up then as we run it back we're gonna work on the cradle to secure the ball again hand at the plastic that's going to help with our control of the ball and keep it in there
