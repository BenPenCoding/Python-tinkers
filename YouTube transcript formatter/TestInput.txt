hi guys in this clip we are gonna review
0:02
the four stick skills needed to play
0:04
lacrosse are passing catching scooping
0:07
and cradling let's dive right into it
0:09
first we're going to talk about passing
0:12
when it comes to passing let's first
0:13
talk about our hand placement we're
0:15
gonna put our dominant hand right in the
0:18
middle of the stick and our other hand
0:20
writes on the bottom from there I'm
0:22
going to use the rebounder to
0:24
demonstrate we're gonna point push and
0:26
pull we're going to point our butt in
0:28
and point our elbow all right
0:30
now we're going to push pull to release
0:32
the ball as we get that push-pull motion
0:35
just like any other sport so I'm going
0:38
to football similar to thrown in
0:39
baseball we're gonna step with our
0:41
opposite foot and as soon as you plant
0:44
you snap that ball out of there next
Catching
0:53
we're gonna talk about catching the ball
0:55
again hand placement we're going to take
0:57
our dominant hand and slide it up to the
0:59
plastic of the head we're going to take
1:02
our off hand and put it on the butt end
1:04
of the stick here now from here we need
1:06
to present a target to our teammate so
1:08
that target is getting the stick
1:10
vertical we have an imaginary box by our
1:13
ear in our shoulder notice the stick is
1:14
not in front of my face it's in the box
1:17
now from here I like teaching my kids to
1:20
think of the ball as a water balloon or
1:22
an egg and we have to give with it so we
1:24
don't break that water balloon or that
1:26
egg now as we cushion that ball that
1:28
ball is not bouncing off our plastic and
1:31
falling onto the grass one more thing
1:34
we're not at the hip right we're up
1:37
vertical again the face shape of the
1:39
stick is facing my partner I'm not going
1:41
to twist that at all that's going to
1:43
help me get that give action there we're
1:45
going to use the rebounder again to
1:47
demonstrate a couple reps here
2:02
now we have scooping we're gonna miss
Scooping
2:05
the ball every once in a while but we're
2:06
gonna go chase it down and learn the
2:08
skill of scooping it up again hand
2:10
placement hand up at the plastic bottom
2:13
hand at the very bottom of the stick
2:15
this helps our hand-eye coordination and
2:17
connecting that scoop a little bit
2:18
better we're gonna plant our dominant
2:20
foot next to the ball yeah the stick low
2:22
and our own body low I'm bending at the
2:25
knees so my body's low you see a lot of
2:27
kids try and scoop where they're picking
2:29
at it they gotta get the butt end of the
2:31
stick low so now I can get under the
2:34
ball and scoop through it now we're
cradling
2:36
going to go over cradling cradling is
2:38
very important to keep the ball in the
2:40
pocket of the stick as we cradle here
2:43
that force is throwing it back to the
2:46
mesh or the netting that makes up the
2:48
pocket you notice my elbow is moving
2:50
back and forth but also I have a loose
2:53
wrist as I come down my wrist is opening
2:55
up as I come up my wrist is closing and
2:59
that's what gets that rocking motion so
3:01
if we miss a pass it's okay we're going
3:03
to go scoop it up then as we run it back
3:05
we're gonna work on the cradle to secure
3:08
the ball again hand at the plastic
3:11
that's going to help with our control of
3:13
the ball and keep it in there
